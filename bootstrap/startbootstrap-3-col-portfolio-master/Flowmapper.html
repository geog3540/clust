      <h4 class="my-4">1. Justification of your flow map design. Please refer to the references to justify your choice of flow map symbology, including the point symbols, flow symbols, and the background choropleth map. Justify the choice of your node, flow and choropleth symbology, which should be different than the maps published in FlowMapper article and the tutorial video.</h4>
      <p class="card-text">I chose to represent my flows through both line width and color. Although it was stated in the Koylu and Guo article that the line weight is the most important visual symbol, I think that it is also helpful for better distinguishing between the line widths at a glance to also inclue color. Because the flows that were present in this data did not have much overlap, there was little
    concern with the placement of the lines on top of each other or what should go on the top or bottom. I also chose to only map the top 100 flows to help reduce that visual clutter and only represent the largest flows. Because Monotone Arrowheads (MA) out preformed all of the other line symbology choices in both response time and correctness, I decided to use that.
    I also decided to use the red flow lines and the blue background map so it was easier to distinguish between the flow lines and the background map. The directional arrows were also used with the arrow heads moving counter-clockwise with the arrowhead on the right side as was discussed in the Koylu and Guo article. I also chose to outline both my flows and background map with black outlines so they were
  clearly distinguished and easy to differentiate.   </p>
  <h4 class="my-4">2. Interpretation of flow patterns:

  </h4>
  <p class="card-text">       ........                                                       </p>
    <h5 class="my-4"> Places that attract (receive) the most flows, and the places that send the most flows. </h5>
    <p class="card-text"> It appears that the places that recieve the most flows in this map are also the places that send the most flows. Especially between the states of Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Arkansas. There is a pattern where people are migrating from one of these states into the other.
      But overall, it seems like the place that sends the most flows is Either Virginia or North Carolina because they both had negative net flows. While they did not have many flows that were in the top 100 flows, they still must have had many people flow in smaller flows because they have negative net flows overall.
      The states that recieve the greatest number of flows are Kentucky, Tennesse, Ohio, and New York. These states were all of the states that had the largest net flow patterns. These patterns can also be seen in the flows that are going into these states. </p>
      <h5 class="my-4"> General direction of flows (e.g., north-south, east-west, etc.) with context to the geography of the flow data set. </h5>
      <p class="card-text"> The general direction of the flows is between more of the middle America states. But overall, it seems like most of the flows are occuring in the Northern part of the study area. It appears that overall, the greatest number of flows are occuring between neighboring states and that there is a small amount of cross country or multiple state moves, which makes sense for this time period. </p>
      <h5 class="my-4"> Flow patterns in relation to location characteristics displayed by node symbol and choropleth base map. </h5>
      <p class="card-text"> The flow patterns that we can see in the node symbols and the choropleth base map are not represented fantastically by the flows. Because we chose to show only the top 100 flows, it appears that many of the moves in this time period must have been on smaller scale flows. Some of the states with the greatest or least number of net flow or total flow have little flow arrows associated with them. This, again, is most likely due to the fact that the flows coming from/going to these states are not large enough to warrant representation in the top 100 flows. </p>
